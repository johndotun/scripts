dynamics  strt              leap       langevin -
 nstep     1500000 -! The number of steps to be taken.
 timest    0.002 -! Time step for dynamics in picoseconds.
                 -!  The default value is 0.001 picoseconds.
 iunread     -1  -! Fortran unit from which the dynamics restart
                 -! file should be read. A value of -1 means don't
                 -! read any file
 iunwrite      -1 -! Fortran unit on which the dynamics restart fil
                 -! e for the present run is to be written. A valu
                 -! e of -1 don't read any file. Formatted output.
 firstt      300 -! The initial temperature at which the velociti
                 -! es have to be assigned at to begin the dynami
                 -! cs run. Important only for the initial stage
                 -!of a dynamics run.
 finalt     300  -! The desired final (equilibrium) temperature
                 -! for the system. Important for all stages excep
                 -! t initiation.
! tstruc   375   -!The temperature at which the starting structure
!                 -!has been equilibrated.  Used to assign velociti
!                 -!es so that equal partition of energy will yield
!                 -!the correct equilibrate temperature.  -999.
!                 -! is a default which causes the program to
!                 -!assign velocities at T=1.25*FIRSTT.
 tconstant       -! false   Flag to indicate that constant
                 -! temperature code will be used.
 tcoupling  0.5 -! The coupling decay time in picoseconds for
               - !the- temperature. A good value for this is 5 ps
 trefer   300  - !TREFerence FINALT The reference temperature for

               - ! averages and rms fluctuations of the major
               - ! energy values. If this number is less than

              - !root of negative number errors will occur.

               -!as well as printing on unit 6, the energy data
               -!of the dynamics run.
 nsavc    10000 -! 10 The step frequency for writing coordinates.
 nsavv    10000 -!10 The step frequency for writing velocities.
 iuncrd   14   -! -1  Fortran unit on which the coordinates of the
               -! dynamics ruN are to be saved. A value of -1 means
               -! no coordinates should be written. Unformatted output.
 iunvel  -1    -! -1 Fortran unit on which the velocities of the
               -! dynamics run are to be saved. -1 means don't write.

 kunit    13   -!-1     Fortran unit on which the total energy and
               -! some of its components along with the temperature
               -! during the run are written using formatted output.
 ihbfrq   0    -!50  The frequency of regenerating the hydrogen
               -! bond list. Analogous to INBFRQ
 ilbfrq   0    -! 50 The frequency for checking whether an atom is
               -!  in the Langevin region, defined by RBUF, or not.
 iasvel   1    -! assign velocity
            -! the option for the choice of method for the
